<p>Quartermasters support the Officer of the Deck and Navigator in all 
navigation procedures on the ship's bridge. They ensure the ship's safe 
navigation, maintain reliable communication with other vessels and shore 
tations, monitor and record weather conditions, and conduct celestial navigation 
observations. Additionally, they are responsible for maintaining ECDIS-N 
systems, charts, visual signaling instruments, weather monitoring equipment, 
and keeping records for the ship's log.</p>

<h3>Work Environment</h3>

<p>Upon graduating from "A" school, USN Quartermasters are deployed to various 
types of ships. Full-Time Support (FTS) Quartermasters are stationed on Naval 
Reserve Force (NRF) ships within the continental United States (CONUS). After 
completing their sea tours, FTS Quartermasters are assigned to reserve centers 
across the nation, including inland areas. At these reserve centers, they are 
responsible for training and managing Selected Reserve Personnel. Over a 
20-year Navy career, Quartermasters typically spend about 60 percent of their 
time on fleet units and 40 percent at shore stations.</p>
